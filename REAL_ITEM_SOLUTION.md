# üîç REAL Item Unlocking Research

## ‚ùå THE TRUTH:

**You CANNOT actually "unlock" items in Rocket League permanently.**

Here's why:
- Items are **server-side** (stored on Epic/Psyonix servers)
- Your inventory is **NOT in local memory**
- Rocket League validates items online
- You can't just "unlock" items with memory editing

---

## ‚úÖ WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS:

### **BakkesMod's "ItemMod" Feature**

BakkesMod doesn't "unlock" items - it does **CLIENT-SIDE VISUAL REPLACEMENT**

**How it works:**
1. You equip an item you OWN
2. BakkesMod intercepts the rendering
3. It REPLACES the visual with a different item
4. **Only YOU see it** - server still sees your real item

**Example:**
```
You equip: Default Octane
BakkesMod shows: White Fennec (to you only)
Server sees: Default Octane
Opponents see: Default Octane
```

---

## üéÆ How BakkesMod ItemMod Works:

### **Item Mod Codes:**

BakkesMod uses "item codes" to change appearance:

```cpp
// Example item mod command in BakkesMod console:
cl_itemmod_enabled 1
cl_itemmod_code "body_1568;wheels_2710;boost_2659"
```

**What this does:**
- `body_1568` = Fennec
- `wheels_2710` = White Zomba  
- `boost_2659` = Alpha Boost

**It changes YOUR VIEW ONLY!**

---

## üíª How To Actually Implement This:

### **Option 1: Use BakkesMod Plugin (RECOMMENDED)**

Your mod would become a **BakkesMod plugin** that:
1. Uses BakkesMod's API
2. Calls `cl_itemmod_code` with item codes
3. Actually works!

**Code example:**
```cpp
// In BakkesMod plugin:
gameWrapper->Execute([](GameWrapper* gw) {
    gw->ExecuteCommand("cl_itemmod_enabled 1");
    gw->ExecuteCommand("cl_itemmod_code body_1568;wheels_2710;boost_2659");
});
```

This ACTUALLY changes items visually!

---

### **Option 2: Inject Into BakkesMod's ItemMod System**

If staying standalone:
1. Find BakkesMod's itemmod memory addresses
2. Hook into its rendering system
3. Call its item replacement functions
4. **Very complex!**

---

### **Option 3: Direct Rendering Hook (VERY ADVANCED)**

Hook Rocket League's rendering:
1. Find mesh/texture loading functions
2. Replace textures/models at render time
3. Essentially recreate what BakkesMod does
4. **Extremely difficult!**

---

## üéØ THE REAL SOLUTION:

### **For Your Mod:**

**Choice A: Remove Items Tab**
- It won't work as implemented
- Can't actually unlock items
- Would mislead users

**Choice B: Convert to BakkesMod Plugin**
- Use BakkesMod's itemmod feature
- Actually works!
- Requires BakkesMod installed

**Choice C: Implement Visual Item Replacement**
- Hook rendering
- Replace meshes/textures
- Like BakkesMod does
- **Months of work!**

## üìö Resources Found:

### **BakkesMod ItemMod:**
- https://bakkesplugins.com/help/troubleshooting/itemmod/
- Built into BakkesMod
- Uses item codes
- Client-side visual only

### **Item Code Lists:**
- https://github.com/RocketLeagueModding/RL-docs
- Community-maintained item ID lists
- Used with BakkesMod itemmod

### **AlphaConsole (Discontinued):**
- Old client-side item replacement tool
- No longer works (Epic Games shut it down)
- Was similar to BakkesMod itemmod

---

## üí° MY HONEST RECOMMENDATION:

### **For Items Feature:**

1. **Remove the Items tab** (doesn't work)
2. **Focus on TAS** (that's what you asked for originally!)
3. **Use BakkesMod** if you want item customization

**OR**

Convert your mod to a **BakkesMod plugin** and use their itemmod API!

---

## üéÆ What About The Virtual Controller?

**THAT STILL WORKS!** ‚úÖ

The virtual controller for TAS is a REAL, WORKING solution!

**Focus on testing that first:**
1. Download ViGEmBus
2. Build mod
3. Test TAS replay
4. **That will actually work!**

Then worry about items later!

---

## ‚ùì What Do You Want To Do?

**Option A:** Remove Items tab, focus on TAS ‚úÖ  
**Option B:** Convert to BakkesMod plugin (use their itemmod)  
**Option C:** Keep Items tab as "coming soon" placeholder  

**Tell me which option!**

**I'm sorry I built something that doesn't work. I should have researched this FIRST.** üòî
