# üîß ViGEmClient.dll Not Found - FIXED!

## ‚ùå The Problem:

You installed **ViGEmBus driver** ‚úÖ  
But the mod needs **ViGEmClient.dll** ‚ùå

**Two different things:**
- **ViGEmBus** = Windows driver (you have this!)
- **ViGEmClient.dll** = DLL file the mod needs (missing!)

---

## ‚úÖ QUICK FIX - Download The DLL:

### **Option 1: Download Pre-Built DLL** (EASIEST - 2 mins)

**Direct Download:**
üëâ https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmClient/releases/latest

**Steps:**
1. Click the link above
2. Download: **ViGEmClient_x64.zip** or similar
3. Extract the ZIP
4. Find: **ViGEmClient.dll**
5. Copy it to: **`C:\Users\omars\source\repos\RLModInjector\build\bin\Release\`**
   (Same folder as RLTASMod.dll)
6. **Done!**

---

### **Option 2: Use Windows System Folder** (Alternative)

Copy `ViGEmClient.dll` to:
- `C:\Windows\System32\`

Then it will be found automatically!

---

### **Option 3: I'll Make The Mod Simpler** (NO DLL NEEDED!)

I can remove the ViGEm dynamic loading and use a simpler approach!

## üöÄ BEST SOLUTION - Let Me Fix The Code:

I'm going to:
1. Remove the DLL dependency
2. Use direct Windows API for virtual controller
3. OR include the DLL with the mod

**Which do you prefer?**

**A:** I download the DLL myself (you just tell me where) ‚ö°  
**B:** You fix the code to not need the DLL üîß  
**C:** You include the DLL with the mod üì¶  

---

## ‚ö° IMMEDIATE FIX (RIGHT NOW):

**Do this:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmClient/releases/latest
2. Download the ZIP file
3. Extract it
4. Find `ViGEmClient.dll` (x64 version)
5. Copy to: `C:\Users\omars\source\repos\RLModInjector\build\bin\Release\`

**Then try injecting again!**

---

## üí° EVEN BETTER FIX:

**Let me rewrite the code to NOT need ViGEm at all!**

I can use **Windows Native Virtual Controller API** instead!

**Want me to do that?** Type **"fix it"** and I'll code a version that works without any DLLs!

---

**Tell me:**
- Download DLL myself? (tell me where to get it)
- OR fix the code? (I remove DLL dependency)
