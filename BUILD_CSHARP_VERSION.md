# Building the C# Version (EASIER!)

## ✅ Much Simpler - Just Use Visual Studio!

You noticed the existing `RocketLeagueTAS.sln` - that's a **C# version** that's MUCH easier to build!

---

## 🚀 Quick Build (5 minutes)

### Option 1: Visual Studio (Recommended)

1. **Download Visual Studio Community 2022** (if not installed)
   - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/
   - During install, select: ☑ **.NET desktop development**
   - (Much smaller than C++ - only ~2-3 GB)

2. **Open the solution**
   - Double-click `RocketLeagueTAS.sln`
   - Visual Studio will open

3. **Restore packages**
   - Visual Studio should automatically restore NuGet packages
   - If not: Right-click solution → "Restore NuGet Packages"

4. **Build**
   - Build → Build Solution (or press Ctrl+Shift+B)
   - Wait a few seconds

5. **Done!**
   - Output files in: `bin/Debug/` or `bin/Release/`

## 📁 What You Get

The C# version includes:

- **RocketLeagueTAS.DLL** - Main TAS DLL
- **RocketLeagueTAS.GUI** - Standalone GUI application  
- **RocketLeagueTAS.Injector** - DLL injector

## 🆚 C# vs C++ Version

| Feature | C# Version | C++ Version |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Build Difficulty** | ⭐ Easy | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Hard |
| **Requirements** | Visual Studio + .NET | Visual Studio + CMake + Dependencies |
| **Build Time** | 30 seconds | 5 minutes |
| **GUI Type** | Windows Forms | ImGui overlay |
| **F9 Toggle** | ❌ No (separate window) | ✅ Yes (in-game) |
| **Setup** | ✅ Simple | ❌ Complex |

---

## ⚙️ Using the C# Version

### After building:

1. **Start Rocket League**

2. **Run the injector**
   ```
   RocketLeagueTAS.Injector.exe
   ```
   Run as Administrator!

3. **Use the GUI**
   - The GUI window will appear
   - Control recording/replay from there
   - (Not in-game like the C++ version)

---

## 🎯 Which Should You Use?

### Use C# Version if:
- ✅ You want something that builds quickly
- ✅ You're okay with a separate GUI window
- ✅ You just want to test the functionality

### Use C++ Version if:
- ✅ You want the F9 in-game overlay
- ✅ You want BakkesMod-style integration
- ✅ You're willing to set up the build tools

## 🔄 Switching Between Versions

You have both in the same folder:

**C# Version:**
- `RocketLeagueTAS.sln` ← Build this
- Output: `bin/Debug/`

**C++ Version:**
- `CMakeLists.txt` ← Build this
- Output: `build/bin/Release/`

They're separate - choose whichever you prefer!

**Next step:** Just open `RocketLeagueTAS.sln` and build! 🚀
