## ⚡ Quick Summary:

**We now:**
- Create a virtual Xbox 360 controller ✅
- Send TAS inputs through it ✅
- Rocket League accepts them perfectly! ✅

## 🎮 How It Works:

```
Your TAS Mod
    ↓
Creates Virtual Xbox Controller
    ↓
Sends inputs (throttle, jump, etc.)
    ↓
Rocket League thinks it's a real controller
    ↓
PERFECT INPUT REPLAY! ✅
```
