# 🧪 Testing Your In-Game TAS Mod

## ✅ What's Working:
- DLL injection ✅
- F9 toggle ✅
- GUI shows up ✅

## 🔧 Just Fixed:
- Recording start issue
- Auto-create TAS if missing
- Speed slider updates
- Better UI feedback

---

## 🚀 How to Test (After Rebuild):

### Quick Test Workflow:

1. **Open F9 GUI**
   - Press F9 in Rocket League

2. **Create a TAS**
   - Go to Controls tab
   - Type a name: "test1"
   - Click "New TAS"
   - Should see: "TAS Created!"

3. **Start Recording**
   - Click "Start" button
   - Should show: "RECORDING..." in red
   - Do some inputs (drive, jump, boost)
   - Watch for 3-5 seconds

4. **Stop Recording**
   - Click "Stop Recording"

5. **Update the TAS**
   - Click "Update" button
   - This saves the recorded inputs

6. **Test Replay**
   - Click "Start" again
   - Should replay your inputs!

---

## 🐛 If Recording Still Doesn't Work:

Try this simpler test:

1. **Press F9**
2. **Don't create a TAS**
3. **Just click "Start"**
   - It should auto-create one and start recording
4. **Drive around for 3 seconds**
5. **Click "Stop"**
6. **Click "Update"**
7. **Click "Start" again**
   - Should replay!

---

## 🔍 What to Look For:

### When Recording:
- Text says "RECORDING..." in red
- You can play normally
- Inputs should feel normal

### When Replaying:
- Car might teleport to start position
- Inputs play back automatically
- Should feel "on rails"

---

## 📊 Check the Loaded TAS Tab:

After recording and updating:
- Go to "Loaded TAS" tab
- Should show:
  - TAS name
  - Frame count (should be > 0)
  - Duration (should match your recording time)

---

## ⚙️ Test Speed Sliders:

1. **Set Record Speed to 0.5x**
2. **Click Start** (to record)
3. **Drive slowly**
4. **Click Stop, then Update**
5. **Set Replay Speed to 1.0x**
6. **Click Start**
7. **Should replay 2x faster!**

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior:

### First Time:
```
1. F9 → GUI opens
2. Type name "test"
3. "New TAS" → Creates TAS
4. "Start" → Begins recording
5. Drive around
6. "Stop" → Ends recording
7. "Update" → Saves inputs
8. "Start" → Replays inputs
```

### After First TAS:
```
1. F9 → GUI opens
2. "Start" → Replays existing TAS
3. Press W during replay → Stops replay, starts recording
4. Drive differently
5. "Stop" → Ends recording
6. "Update" → Appends new inputs
7. "Start" → Replays updated TAS
```
