# Installing Build Tools - Step by Step Guide

## The Problem

You're seeing: **"Visual Studio compiler not found!"**

This means you need to install the C++ compiler to build the project.

## ‚úÖ Solution: Install Visual Studio Build Tools

You have **2 options** (choose one):

### Option 1: Visual Studio Community (Recommended - Full IDE)

   - Wait 10-30 minutes (downloads ~6-8 GB)

5. **Done!**
   - After installation, you can run `build_all.bat` directly

### Option 2: Build Tools Only (Smaller - Just Compiler)
