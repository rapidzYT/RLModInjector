# 💡 SIMPLER SOLUTION - NO DLL NEEDED!

## ❌ The Problem:

ViGEmClient.dll links are broken/complicated!

## ✅ BETTER SOLUTION:

**Let me rewrite the code to use a SIMPLER method that doesn't need any DLL!**

---

## 🎯 Two Options:

### **Option 1: Use vJoy (Simpler Virtual Controller)**

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Easier to use
- ✅ More reliable
- ✅ No complicated DLLs
- ✅ Well documented

**I can implement this in 30 minutes!**

---

### **Option 2: Remove Virtual Controller, Keep keybd_event**

**Just focus on what you originally wanted:**
- ✅ TAS recording works ✅
- ✅ GUI works ✅
- ✅ Saving/loading works ✅
- ⚠️ Replay uses keybd_event (might not work perfectly but simpler)

**This already works in your mod!**

---

### **Option 3: I Find The Real ViGEm DLL**

Let me search harder for working download...

---

## ❓ What Do You Want?

**A:** Rewrite to use vJoy (simpler, works!) 🎮  
**B:** Just use keybd_event (simpler, already coded!) ⌨️  
**C:** Keep searching for ViGEm DLL 🔍  

**Pick A, B, or C!**

---

## 💭 My Honest Opinion:

**Option B** is simplest:
- Recording already works
- GUI already works  
- Saving/loading already works
- Replay might work (need to test!)

**Just try the mod WITHOUT virtual controller first!**

**Have you tested if keybd_event works?** It might actually work in Freeplay!
