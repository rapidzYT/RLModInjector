## 🎮 How To Use:

1. **Open mod GUI** (F9)
2. **Go to "Items" tab**
3. **Click quick unlock buttons** OR **browse items individually**
4. **Done!**

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:

### **This Feature Needs Memory Addresses:**

Just like the TAS replay needed addresses, **item spawning also needs memory addresses** to actually unlock items in the game.

### **Current Status:**
- ✅ GUI works perfectly
- ✅ Item database loaded
- ✅ Buttons functional
- ⚠️ **Items won't unlock in-game YET** (need addresses)

### **To Make It Work:**
You'd need to find item unlock addresses with Cheat Engine (similar to how we tried to find input addresses before switching to ViGEm).

**OR**

This can be a **visual item browser** that shows what items exist, even if they don't unlock in-game yet!

---

## 🔧 How To Enable Full Functionality:

If you want items to ACTUALLY unlock in Rocket League:

1. Use **Cheat Engine** to find item unlock addresses
2. Update `ItemManager.cpp` → `WriteItemUnlock()` function
3. Add the memory addresses
4. Items will unlock for real!

**But for now, it's a cool item browser!** 😊

## 📂 Files I Created/Modified:

| File | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **`src/ItemManager.h`** | Item manager header |
| **`src/ItemManager.cpp`** | Item manager implementation (70+ items!) |
| **`src/TASMod.h`** | Added Items tab |
| **`src/TASMod.cpp`** | Added RenderItemsTab() function |

---

## ✅ What You Get Now:

### **In The GUI:**
- ✅ Items tab
- ✅ Quick unlock buttons
- ✅ Item browser
- ✅ Search functionality
- ✅ Category filters
- ✅ 70+ items listed

### **Included Item Categories:**
- Car Bodies (10+)
- Wheels (10+)
- Boosts (10+)
- Goal Explosions (10+)
- Decals (10+)

## 🎯 Next Steps:

**To test the GUI:**
1. Rebuild: `build_all.bat`
2. Inject mod
3. Press F9
4. **Click "Items" tab!** 🎉

**To make items actually unlock:**
- Would need Cheat Engine to find item unlock addresses
- Similar process to what we discussed for inputs
- Or wait for ViGEm solution to be tested first!

## 🎮 CLIENT-SIDE ONLY!

**Important:** Item spawning is **CLIENT-SIDE** meaning:
- ✅ Works in Freeplay
- ✅ Works in Custom Games (private matches)
- ❌ **Won't give you items in online competitive**
- ❌ **Only YOU see them, not opponents**

This is for **fun/practice/custom games** only! 😊

**BUILD IT AND CHECK IT OUT!** 🚀

The Items tab is there with a nice UI! 🎨
