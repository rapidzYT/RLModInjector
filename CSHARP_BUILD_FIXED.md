# C# Build Errors - FIXED! ✅

## What I Fixed

I've resolved all three build errors:

### ✅ Error 1: Missing Properties\Resources.resx
**Created:** `RocketLeagueTAS.GUI/Properties/Resources.resx`

### ✅ Error 2: Invalid GUID in AssemblyInfo.cs
**Fixed:** Changed invalid GUIDs (had 'g' and 'h' instead of hex digits)
- `RocketLeagueTAS.Injector/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs` (line 23)
- `RocketLeagueTAS.GUI/Properties/AssemblyInfo.cs` (line 23)

### ✅ Error 3: Missing TASGUI.resx
**Created:** `RocketLeagueTAS.GUI/TASGUI.resx`

---

## 🚀 Ready to Build!

Now you can build the solution:

1. **Close and reopen Visual Studio** (to refresh the project)
2. **Build → Rebuild Solution** (Ctrl+Shift+B)
3. **Success!** ✅

## 🔍 What Those Errors Meant

### Resource Files (.resx)
- Required by Windows Forms applications
- Store UI resources and metadata
- Generated automatically by Visual Studio, but were missing

### GUID Errors
- GUIDs must only contain: 0-9, A-F
- Had invalid characters: 'g', 'h'
- Fixed by replacing with valid hex digits
