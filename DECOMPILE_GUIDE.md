# üîì Decompile Logical Loader - Learn How It REALLY Works!

## üéØ Perfect Plan!

If "Logical Loader" already has **working TAS and item spawner**, we can:
1. **Decompile it**
2. **See the REAL code** that works
3. **Learn how they do it**
4. **Copy the methods** that work!

---

## üîß How To Decompile It:

### **Step 1: Check If It's .NET or Native**

**Run this in Command Prompt:**
```bash
cd "C:\path\to\where\logical-loader.exe\is"
file logical-loader.exe
```

**OR simpler - try opening it in dnSpy first (works for .NET):**

## üì• **Tools You Need:**

### **For .NET/C# Executables** (Most likely):

**1. dnSpy** (BEST - full decompiler + debugger)
- Download: https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases/latest
- Download: **dnSpy-net-win64.zip**
- Extract and run **dnSpy.exe**

**2. ILSpy** (Alternative)
- Download: https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy/releases/latest

**3. dotPeek** (JetBrains - also good)
- Download: https://www.jetbrains.com/decompiler/

---

### **For Native C++ Executables**:

**1. Ghidra** (FREE, from NSA!)
- Download: https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/releases

**2. IDA Free** (Industry standard)
- Download: https://hex-rays.com/ida-free/

**3. x64dbg** (Debugger + disassembler)
- Download: https://x64dbg.com/

## üöÄ **Quick Decompile Steps:**

### **Using dnSpy (if it's .NET):**

1. **Download dnSpy** from link above
2. **Extract the ZIP**
3. **Run dnSpy.exe**
4. **File ‚Üí Open** ‚Üí Select `logical-loader.exe`
5. **If it opens successfully** ‚Üí It's .NET! ‚úÖ
6. **Browse the code** - you can see EVERYTHING!
7. **Look for:**
   - TAS classes
   - Input injection code
   - Item spawner code
   - Memory addresses they use

---

### **Using Ghidra (if it's C++):**

1. **Download Ghidra**
2. **Extract and run**
3. **Create new project**
4. **Import** `logical-loader.exe`
5. **Analyze** (takes a few minutes)
6. **Browse decompiled code**

---

## üîç **What To Look For:**

Once decompiled, search for:

### **For TAS:**
- `Input`
- `Replay`
- `Record`
- `keybd_event` or `SendInput`
- `VirtualController` or `ViGEm` or `vJoy`
- `PlayerInput` or `CarInput`

### **For Item Spawner:**
- `Item`
- `Unlock`
- `Inventory`
- `Spawn`
- Memory addresses (like `0x...`)
- `WriteProcessMemory`

---

## üí° **What We'll Learn:**

From the decompiled code we can see:

‚úÖ **HOW they do input replay** (what method actually works!)
‚úÖ **HOW they spawn items** (if it's possible at all!)
‚úÖ **Memory addresses** they use
‚úÖ **What APIs** they call
‚úÖ **The REAL solution** to your problems!

---

## üìã **Do This NOW:**

1. **Download dnSpy**: https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy/releases/latest
2. **Extract it**
3. **Run dnSpy.exe**
4. **Open logical-loader.exe**
5. **Take screenshots** of the code you find
6. **Share them here!**

---

## üéØ **What To Send Me:**

Once you decompile it:

1. **Screenshot** of the main code structure
2. **Find the TAS code** - screenshot it
3. **Find the item spawner code** - screenshot it
4. **Look for memory addresses** - write them down

**Then I can:**
- Analyze how they REALLY do it
- Copy the working methods
- Fix your mod to work the same way!

---

## ‚ö° **This Is GENIUS!**

Instead of guessing, we'll **LEARN FROM WORKING CODE!**

**Download dnSpy NOW and open that exe!**

Then tell me:
- Does it open? (Is it .NET?)
- What code do you see?
- Can you find TAS or Item code?

**LET'S DO THIS!** üî•

---

## üÜò **If You Need Help:**

Tell me:
- Where is logical-loader.exe? (full path)
- What happens when you open it in dnSpy?
- Do you see code or gibberish?

**I'll guide you through it!** üí™
