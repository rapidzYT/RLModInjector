## 🏗️ Step 2: Rebuild Your Mod (2 mins)

### **In Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt:**

```bash
cd C:\Users\omars\source\repos\RLModInjector
build_all.bat
```

**Wait for it to compile...**

---

## 🎮 Step 3: Test It! (1 min)

1. **Inject mod** into Rocket League
2. **Press F9** to open GUI
3. You should see a popup: **"Virtual Controller Initialized! ✅"**
4. **Record** some driving (5 seconds)

## 🎯 How It Works

### **Before (Didn't Work):**
```
Your Mod → keybd_event('W') → RL ignores it ❌
```

### **After (Works Perfectly!):**
```
Your Mod → Virtual Xbox Controller → RL accepts it ✅
```

**Rocket League thinks you have a real Xbox 360 controller plugged in!**
