# 🔧 Quick Fix - ImGui Folder Structure

## The Problem
The build can't find `imgui_impl_win32.h` - this means the backends folder isn't in the right place.

---

## ✅ Correct Structure Should Be:

```
C:\Users\omars\source\repos\RLModInjector\
└── external\
    └── imgui\
        ├── imgui.h              ← Main files
        ├── imgui.cpp
        ├── imgui_draw.cpp
        ├── imgui_tables.cpp
        ├── imgui_widgets.cpp
        ├── imconfig.h
        ├── imgui_internal.h
        └── backends\            ← IMPORTANT! Must have this folder
            ├── imgui_impl_win32.h
            ├── imgui_impl_win32.cpp
            ├── imgui_impl_dx11.h
            └── imgui_impl_dx11.cpp
```

---

## 🔍 Let's Check Your Setup

### In File Explorer:

1. Open: `C:\Users\omars\source\repos\RLModInjector\external\imgui\`

2. **Do you see:**
   - [ ] `imgui.h` file?
   - [ ] `backends` folder?

3. **Open the `backends` folder**

4. **Do you see:**
   - [ ] `imgui_impl_win32.h`?
   - [ ] `imgui_impl_dx11.h`?

---

## ❌ If Backends Folder is Missing:

You need to re-copy ImGui with the backends folder!

### Fix:

1. **Delete** the current `external\imgui\` folder

2. **Go back to** the ImGui ZIP you downloaded

3. **Extract it again**

4. **This time, copy EVERYTHING** including:
   - All .h and .cpp files in the root
   - **The entire `backends` folder**

5. **Paste into:** `C:\Users\omars\source\repos\RLModInjector\external\imgui\`

---

## ✅ Quick Verification

After copying, you should be able to navigate to:
```
C:\Users\omars\source\repos\RLModInjector\external\imgui\backends\imgui_impl_win32.h
```

**Can you open that file?** If yes, you're good!

---

## 🚀 After Fixing:

Run the build again:
```bash
build_all.bat
```

It should work! ✅
