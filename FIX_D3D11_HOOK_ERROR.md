# üîß Fix "Failed to Hook D3D11" Error

## The Problem

You're getting: **"Failed to initialize D3D11 Hook"** or **"Failed to hook D3D11"**

This means the mod can't hook into Rocket League's graphics rendering.

---

## ‚úÖ Solutions (Try These in Order):

### Solution 1: Make Sure RL is Using DirectX 11

**Rocket League might be using DirectX 9 or 12!**

1. **Start Rocket League**
2. **Go to Settings ‚Üí Video**
3. **Look for "Rendering API" or "Graphics API"**
4. **Set it to:** DirectX 11 (or DX11)
5. **Restart Rocket League**
6. **Try injecting again**

---

### Solution 2: Inject at the Right Time

**Timing matters!**

1. **Start Rocket League**
2. **Wait for main menu to fully load**
3. **Go to freeplay**
4. **THEN run the injector**

Don't inject too early (during startup) or the D3D device might not be ready!

---

### Solution 3: Run with Better Privileges

1. **Close Rocket League**
2. **Right-click Rocket League**
3. **Run as Administrator**
4. **Then inject with the injector as Admin**

---

### Solution 4: Check Anti-Cheat

**Rocket League might have anti-cheat blocking hooks:**

1. **Use ONLY in offline/freeplay mode**
2. **Disable any overlays:**
   - Discord overlay
   - GeForce Experience overlay
   - Steam overlay
   - Any other game overlays

3. **Try again**

---

### Solution 5: Alternative - Use Without GUI

The mod can still WORK without the GUI hook! The recording system doesn't need D3D11.

**I can create a version that:**
- Works without DirectX hooking
- Uses keyboard shortcuts instead of GUI
- Shows status in a separate window
- Still records/replays perfectly

**Want me to create this simpler version?**

## üîç Diagnostic Questions:

To help me fix this, tell me:

1. **What DirectX version is Rocket League using?**
   - Check in Video Settings

2. **When do you inject?**
   - At startup?
   - After main menu?
   - In freeplay?

3. **What's the exact error message?**
   - "Failed to hook D3D11"?
   - "Failed to initialize D3D11 Hook"?
   - Something else?

4. **Are other overlays working?**
   - Does Discord overlay work in RL?
   - Does Steam overlay work?

---

## üí° Quick Test:

**Check if RL is using DX11:**

1. Start Rocket League
2. Settings ‚Üí Video
3. Look for DirectX or Graphics API setting
4. If it says DX9 or DX12, change to DX11
5. Restart RL
6. Try injecting again

## üöÄ Alternative Approach:

If D3D11 hooking keeps failing, I can create:

### **Option A: Simplified GUI Version**
- Uses a different hooking method
- Less complex, more reliable
- Still in-game

### **Option B: Keyboard Shortcut Version**
- No GUI needed
- All keyboard controls
- More reliable injection
- Status window separate

### **Option C: Hybrid Version**
- C# GUI window + C++ recording
- Best of both worlds
- Most reliable

**Which would you prefer if D3D11 keeps failing?**

**First, try checking the DirectX version in RL settings!** Tell me what it says! üéÆ
